## 💫 Motivation

Shiryoku (Resources) is an initiative to reduce the resistance between students and the resources that they require to up-skill themselves.
I made this Project during my third year the philosophy, that;

> Be the Senior You Needed the most as a Junior.

With Shiryoku, you can expect the top resources to be available to you based on your needs and also comes with a roadmap for a structured approach to the resources for easier understanding of how to utilize it to its fullest!
